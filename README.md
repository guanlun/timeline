timeline
========

A dynamic timeline generator for history learners to better organize different historial events so that they can have a better understanding of the relationship in between.

I built this simple webapp to help myself in an assignment during a undergrad general education course in history of China's diplomacy.

This webapp can organize individual events as well as periods. See the picture below for illustration.
